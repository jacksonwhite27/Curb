# Curb
Curb is a Decentralized Peer to Peer Network for finding available parking spaces throughout the US.

# Introduction
Curb was created for the future of the automotive industry. Imagine a world where locating a parking space can be done before you arrive. With Curb, this is possible. Curb works with owners of Parking Lots & Garages as well as the everyday human. Using Curb allows anyone to list their own parking spot, driveway, and rented space available on the Curb Marketplace.

# Mission
Curbs goal is to disrupt the current $100bn parking and garage industry by allowing virtually anyone to list their parking spaces on the marketplace. Curb can decrease the current cost of paid parking up to 10x, making it extremely affordable for everyone.

# A Bright Future
Using Smart Contracts thanks to the Ethereum blockchain, Curb allows for users to make agreements on short-term and long-term parking deals within seconds. This allows for the safety and security for the seller, as well as the buyer. 

Blockchain technology is only in its beggining stage with it mainly being used for financial services, current predictions state

  - "2021 is shaping up to be the year that, across the board, blockchain moves into the mainstream and a much wider range of economic sectors. Healthcare, transportation, and logistics are just a few of the areas that may benefit from wider blockchain adoption and implementation." (https://bit.ly/3nKQmjR)

Curbs future plans on integrating this new model includes servicing large events, colleges and universities

# Curb Coin
Curb will use CurbCoin (CURB) to complete transcations on the Marketplace

  Curb Coin will be a token built on the Ethereum blockchain and be used for transactions in the Curb Marketplace.

Curb and CurbCoin are seperate entities, CurbCoin is a free to use, open-source project.

# Business Model

Curb makes it easy to understand the our model of monetization

-  For each P2P transaction between space buyer (x) and seller (x), Curb takes 10% commission of the final price of the contract.
  
# Incentives

The consumer and seller incentives for using Curb are simple

- By allowing anyone to list their space on the marketplace, Curb can expand the current availability of parking up to 2x. Using Curb will beat the rates of    parking anywhere else without it.
  
Curb takes into consideration the overall expirience of each user after renting a parking space

  - In our rating system, users selling their spaces will be promoted throughout the market and recieve higher "Seller Ratings" based on the overall expirience people have doing business with them
  
For the consumer, finding available parking is extremely simple. This eliminates the stress of driving in circles looking for space on a busy day.
